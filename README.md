# Learning-NLTK
I am learning, NLTK and through this repository, I will be uploading the codes that I learn one by one.

first of all, You will have to install NLTK via pip.
After installing NLTK, run the "initialise nltk download.py".

All rest of the files deal with single concepts like "Tokenizing", "Stemming", etc.
Try to run the codes and understand the meanings, else google em, or read the comments in my code!!!
