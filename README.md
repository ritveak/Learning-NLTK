# Learning-NLTK

A while ago, I was studying NLP and made this repo for my reference, 
little did I know that others (few of my friends, whom I shared it with) would find it useful as well.
So I added comments even in self-explanatory codes, making it more understandable.
I didn't make it thinking it would be a tutorial, so don't expect it to be a course,
but it is definitely gonna help you a lot if you are a beginner.
Once you get started, the Internet is always a few clicks away for guiding you the path further.


First of all, You will have to install NLTK via pip.
After installing NLTK, run the "initialise nltk download.py".

All rest of the files deal with single concepts like "Tokenizing", "Stemming", etc.
Try to run the codes and understand the meanings, else google em, or read the comments in my code!!!
